So after using an email client that has been [suspected of numerous privacy violations](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/5grsan/do_not_use_the_spark_email_client_by_readdle/), I decided to up my security precautions. I'm still looking for a decent macOS based email client, but in the meantime, I have enabled (*and prefer*) PGP email communication.

If you care about your privacy, then I suggest you do the same. There are numerous tutorials online on this subject, so I see no point in duplicating them; I will link a couple of useful ones below:

**You can access my public key Keshav Chawla [keshav1chawla@gmail.com](mailto:keshav1chawla@gmail.com) here: <http://keshavchawla.com/KeshavChawla(AD658ACF)Public.asc>**

You can use this key to encrypt and secure our messages.

To start using it, you'll need to install an OpenPGP software on your computer. Below you'll find a list of possible solutions for your operating system:

iOS: <https://itunes.apple.com/app/ipgmail/id430780873?mt=8>

Android: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain>

Import the public key into your local OpenPGP Key-Manager.

Please let me know if you have suggestions for a MacOS email client.

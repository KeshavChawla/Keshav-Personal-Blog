I thought I would take a quick moment to share some of the tips I've been using to work from home.

* Having a dedicated second monitor allows me to keep all my information open without cluttering up my desktop. Alternatively, if you don't have a second monitor, consider using your computer's built-in split-screen features to prevent without having to switch tabs.

* Rotate between standing up and sitting down at a desk at regular intervals. If you have a standing desk, this is super easy to do. Otherwise, find ways to elevate your laptop on your desk while you stand (large books, on-desk table). I set my phone on 25-minute intervals to switch between sitting and standing.

* I'm a music person, so having a playlist keeps me active throughout the day.

* Open those windows. Having natural sunlight, especially on a sunny day like today, helps to keep spirits up. As a bonus, if you have colour changing lights or RGB strips, program them throughout the day to light your room according to the weather. If it's a really cloudy/rainy day outside, I have my lights automatically turn out - it's a little touch, but it boosts spirits.

* Separate your work environment from your personal environment. Do this with your physical space but also consider separating your virtual space. I use two different accounts on my computer to divide my work environment from everything else. This helps me focus and not get sidetracked.

I will add to this list as I discover even more tips. Happy working!

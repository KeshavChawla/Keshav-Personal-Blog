Hey!

![Simplex Chrome Extension](/assets/img 2020-07-16 at 1.53.44 AM.png "Simplex Chrome Extension")

I just came here to showcase one of the things I have been working on the side.

I have become increasingly annoyed by the clutter by some of the new tab extensions on the google chrome store.

No, I don’t need to have chrome set Google as my home page, and I don’t need to see a list of recently visited sites either.

All my important sites are already placed in my Bookmark bar, and I can access Google directly from the embedded search bar.

Come to think of it, I don’t even really need a homepage or fancy new tab extension.

I just wanted something simple. By simple, I just wanted a nice blank screen that only showed me the following:

* The date
* The time
* A nice motivational quote

That’s it—nothing less and nothing more. So really, I built [Simplex - a chrome extension](https://bit.ly/SIMPLEX) just for me. But here’s to hoping that someone else will also find similar use for Simplex.

I don’t see this as something I plan to support long term, but if you find some use, let me know, and I might just reconsider.

It didn’t take too long or require too much effort either; just some simple Javascript and an Ajax call to [this API](https://favqs.com/api).
